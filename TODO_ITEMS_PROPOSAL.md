   - P1 (Urgent): All final inspections, safety tests, regulatory submissions
   - P2 (High): Equipment installation completion, system commissioning
   - P3 (Normal): Documentation, training, standard tasks
   - P4 (Low): Optional enhancements, future planning

2. **Deadlines**: Consider setting relative deadlines (e.g., "30 days before opening" for final inspections)

3. **Customization**: Users can always add/remove items per project

4. **Phase Grouping**: Consider grouping by construction phase for better workflow

## ❓ Questions for You

**Please review and let me know:**

1. Which categories do you want included by default?
2. Should we set default priorities for certain items?
3. Do you want phase-based organization (Pre-construction, Construction, Testing, Launch)?
4. Any specific Dallas/Texas requirements I should add?
5. Should testing items also have default deadlines (e.g., "7 days before opening")?

**I'm ready to implement whichever items you choose!** 🚀
